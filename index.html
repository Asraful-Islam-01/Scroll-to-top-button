        <h2>What is a Scroll-to-Top Button?</h2>
        <p>
          A scroll-to-top button is a user interface element that allows
          visitors to quickly return to the top of a webpage with a single
          click. This is especially useful for long pages with lots of content,
          improving user experience and navigation efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The button typically appears after the user has scrolled down a
          certain distance, providing a convenient way to navigate back without
          manually scrolling.

        <h2>Benefits of Using This Feature</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing a scroll-to-top button offers several advantages for both
          users and website owners. It enhances accessibility by providing an
          easy navigation option for users who have scrolled through extensive
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feature is particularly valuable on mobile devices where
          scrolling long distances can be cumbersome. It also adds a
          professional touch to your website's user interface.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The button uses JavaScript to detect the user's scroll position. When
          the user scrolls beyond a certain threshold (typically 300 pixels),
          the button smoothly fades into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the button triggers a smooth scroll animation that takes the
          user back to the top of the page, creating a pleasant and fluid user
          experience.

        <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          When implementing a scroll-to-top button, it's important to consider
          its position, size, and appearance. The button should be visible
          without obstructing important content and should match your website's
          overall design aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common practices include using rounded buttons, placing them in the
          bottom-right corner, and ensuring they have sufficient contrast to be
          easily noticed by users.

      <!-- Section 5 -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
          To create an effective scroll-to-top button, ensure it only appears
          after meaningful scroll distance, use smooth animations for both
          appearance and scrolling, and make it easily clickable with adequate
          size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, consider accessibility by ensuring the button is
          keyboard-accessible and has appropriate ARIA labels for screen
          readers.

        <h2>Implementation Tips</h2>
        <p>
          When coding your scroll-to-top button, use CSS transitions for smooth
          visual effects, JavaScript event listeners for scroll detection, and
          the window.scrollTo() method with smooth behavior for the scrolling
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing across different devices and browsers is crucial to ensure
          consistent functionality and appearance for all users.
